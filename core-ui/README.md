# core-ui

Shared UI surface for Jetpack Compose.

## Highlights

- Provides the `PakhshTheme` Material 3 setup used across all applications.
- Hosts reusable Compose components (e.g. swipe-to-dismiss helpers) to keep app modules lean.
- Depends on the Compose BOM so consuming modules can align versions by simply depending on the module.
